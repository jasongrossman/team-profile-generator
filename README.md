# Team-Profile-Generator

![Sample](/src/Sample.JPG "Sample")

## Description:
Create your own organizational chart with an easy-to-use tool. Add a manager, engineers, and interns to populate your team. Include details about them, such as employee ID, emails, etc.

## Instructions:
Clone the repository on your local drive, and then run the following commands:

```
npm init -y
npm install
```

Then, to initialize the application, run the following command in the terminal:

```
node index
```

Follow the terminal instructions. When you are finished adding members to your team, select the "Finished" option in the inquirer prompt. This will terminate the application and generate a new HTML file called:
**My_Team.html** in the root directory.

## Walkthrough:

A walkthrough of the application in action can be found in the src directory [here:](/src/Team_Profile_Generator_Walkthrough.mp4).
